# broadSeq 

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of broadSeq is to do easily RNA-seq data analysis with multiple
methods (usually which needs many different input formats). Here the
user will provide the expression data as a SummarizedExperiment object
and will get results from different methods. This function oriented package will
give user freedom to develop customized and reproducible workflow. Additionally,
it will also help to quickly evaluate different methods easily.

```{r  echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
io_flow <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "broadSeq_pipeline.csv", package = "broadSeq"))

df <- io_flow %>% 
    ggsankey::make_long(Input,  Function, Method, Output,ggpubr)
df$node <- factor(df$node, levels = unique(c( io_flow$Function, io_flow$Method,
                                           io_flow$Output, io_flow$ggpubr)))

pl <- ggplot(df, aes(x = x,                        
                     next_x = next_x,                                     
                     node = node,
                     next_node = next_node,        
                     fill = factor(node),
                     label = node))+scale_x_discrete(position = "top") 

pl <- pl + ggsankey::geom_sankey(flow.alpha = 0.5,  #This Creates the transparency of your node 
                      show.legend = FALSE)      # This determines if you want your legend to show

pl <- pl + ggsankey::geom_sankey_label(show.legend = FALSE,
                             color = "black", 
                             fill = "white") # This specifies the Label format for each node 

pl+labs(x="")+ ggsankey::theme_sankey(base_size = 25)

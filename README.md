# broadSeq

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of broadSeq is to do easily RNA-seq data analysis with multiple
methods (usually which needs many different input formats). Here the
user will provide the expression data as a SummarizedExperiment object
and will get results from different methods. This function oriented
package will give user freedom to develop customized and reproducible
workflow. Additionally, it will also help to quickly evaluate different
methods easily.
